# STAT 598: Machine Learning
### The documents in this repository is my work for the Purdue course STAT 598: Machine Learning.
STAT 598 (also offered as ECE 595) is a graduate level machine learning course commonly taken by students doing their masters or PhD with a focus in machine learning. I had the opportunity to take it as an undergrad and learned a lot about the fundementals of Machine Learning, which helped me a lot in exploring other topics.
